This project was accomplished with a group for CSCI 6380- Data Mining. We used machine learning techniques such as linear regression, bagging, and a neural network. 
To run the code, you need to import pandas and sklearn. You also need to unzip "FinalProjectDataset.csv". Make sure the .py file is in the same directory as the .csv file. 
This project may take a while to run, as the data is pretty large.

See the final project report to read more about our research, preprocessing, model descriptions.
